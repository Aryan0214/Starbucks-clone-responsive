This project is originally made by TraversyMedia on Youtube. I have just recreated his project for learning Purposes.

## Things I learnt by this Project 

I learned how to maintain, clear and concise code throughout. I have learnt a bit of javascript and tried to make it look good on Tablets and Mobile resolutions by adding a hamburger Menu which took me HTML, CSS for styles and JS for make it functionable on clicks. 

## It was fun building the Starbucks Clone Brad. Thanks :)
